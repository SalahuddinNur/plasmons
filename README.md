# plasmons

Python scripts to use Meep FDTD simulation software to calculate plasmonic band structures in graphene.

In order to run simulations on a cluster computer using Slurm workload manager three bash scripts have been added for convenience. (Not needed for serial execution)

To run the meep_code.py script, make sure Meep and its dependencies are installed first (see https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation/)
